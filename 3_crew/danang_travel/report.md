**Chosen Destination: My Khe Beach**

**Rationale:** My Khe Beach offers a blend of accessibility, activities, and natural beauty. Its soft white sand, clear blue water, and gentle waves make it a unique destination, and it's easily accessible from Da Nang city center and the airport. The ideal time to visit is from April to September, offering a favorable window for travel. While the budget information is not specific, general costs for beach activities and food in Da Nang are relatively low, making it an attractive option.

**Destinations Not Selected:**

*   **Sun World Ba Na Hills:** While Sun World Ba Na Hills boasts unique attractions like the Golden Bridge and European-themed architecture, its higher entrance ticket cost (around $37 USD) and lack of clarity on weather conditions throughout the year make it a less appealing option compared to My Khe Beach.

*   **Da Nang Downtown:** Da Nang Downtown offers sightseeing, local eats, and cool architecture, but its focus on luxury travelers and lack of specific accessibility information make it less suitable for a broader range of travelers compared to the more accessible and budget-friendly My Khe Beach.
