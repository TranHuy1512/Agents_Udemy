Okay, I'm ready. Pitch me your best idea. I want to hear about a business that leverages Agentic AI, preferably in the Fintech or SaaS space. Tell me:

*   **What problem are you solving?** Be specific and quantify the pain point.
*   **What's your proposed solution?** How does Agentic AI uniquely address this problem? Don't just say "AI will automate it," explain *how* the agentic nature is crucial.
*   **What's your target market?** Be precise. Who are your ideal customers?
*   **What's your revenue model?** How will you make money?
*   **What are the key risks and challenges?** Be honest.

I'm looking for well-thought-out ideas, not just buzzwords. Convince me this is a viable business opportunity.
